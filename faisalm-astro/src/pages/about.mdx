- This blog was built mainly for me to implement what I've been learning in web development.

- I also love writing. Currently I'm learning English myself. To practice my English, I'll mainly write posts in English.

- If you spot any grammatical errors or typos in this blog, please let me know! You can contact me through one of the social media links listed on the home page, and I'll fix them.

- This blog is a long-term project. There's a lot I want to add to this blog.
